### Strangest Login

Before we get into the meat and bones, a few disclaimers: This is part of my training exercise for a self-paced homework assignment. If you want to use this, feel free!

### What is This

This is a template for creating a website login page. The login features an animation based on the time of day or night. The sun and moon will move according to the time on your local system. Additionally, the template allows users to submit their login credentials with the password displayed as "***". Icons for social media are included and made clickable.

### Why Did I Do This

Practice! This was my first login page, and I did it because I had to.

### How Users Can Use This

**For Users:**
- Hire a programmer.
- Tell them to read this.

**For Programmers:**
- Don't use this code, bro. Seriously.
- I used vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS—no frameworks. I know, right?
- You can replace all images and links.
- Check the "Bugs" section for any issues I’m aware of.
- The JS code handles the moving animation. If you want to adjust it, I’ve included test code for animations using keyframes.

### Who is Doing This

Coding with Strangers, aka Heero

### Features

- [x] Night Mode: Automatically switches to a night mode page based on the time of day.
- [ ] Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes.
- [x] Sun and Moon Animation: The position of the sun and moon changes according to the user's system time.
- Easter Eggs:
  - [x] Stranger Flip: Triggers when the email field contains "do a barrel roll".
  - [x] Moon Change: Changes the moon when the user types "soul".
  - [ ] Password Visibility Toggle: Allows users to show/hide their password.

### What You Will Need

Files Included:
- `index.html` – Main HTML file for the login template.
- `styles.css` – CSS file for styling the template.
- `script.js` – JavaScript file for interactive features and animations.
- `image` folder – You can change images if you like.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:
- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari).

### Bugs

Feel free to submit issues, fork the repository, and make pull requests. Your contributions are welcome! Since I might not address these bugs myself, I’ll probably try to rebuild this in React. Here are the known bugs:

- [ ] Not Responsive
- [ ] Links don't work
- [ ] Show password icon missing
- [ ] Login box not centered
- [ ] Background transition doesn’t fade from day to night (and vice versa)
- [ ] Second moon is too small and facing the wrong way
